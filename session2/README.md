# Terminal

Your terminal will look and act differently depending on your operating system (OS). There are a variety of OSs out there including Ubuntu, Windows, Mac OS, etc. Since the majority of scientific computing is done on [Linux](https://www.linux.org/), that will be the focus of this tutorial. 

## macOS & Linux users

You are ready to proceed. Just open your terminal! I strongly suggest you pay attention to the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2) set up, as you may find this useful when you develop for other OSs. 

## Windows users

The Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) gives you command line access to various Linux distributions. Today, we will be installing WSL2 and setting Ubuntu as our main distribution. 

To install WSL2, run the following command:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

>***Note***: If you run into errors, [click here](https://github.com/phytooracle/ASEMS_Workshop/blob/main/session2/troubleshooting.md) for troubleshooting steps.

# VSCode

We will install VSCode, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by Microsoft.

## macOS & Linux users

1. Install VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Windows/WSL2 users

1. Install VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. Install the Remote - WSL extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl).
